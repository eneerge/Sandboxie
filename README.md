# Sandboxie
### Installer.cmd - Install a Sandboxie Application
This script will:
- Create a sandbox based on how the script is configured
- Copy the contents of the sandbox folder to the Sandboxie sandbox directory. (IE: If you have a copy of "FirefoxVM" sandbox at "E:\Software\Firefox\FirefoxVM", the script will create the "FirefoxVM" Sandbox in Sandboxie, then copy all contents of "FirefoxVM" to your Sandboxie sandbox folder which is usually C:\Sandbox\user\FirefoxVM
- Create start menu shortcuts for the specified exe.
